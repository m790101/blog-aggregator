# Blog Aggregator

## Description

**Blog Aggregator** is a tool that allows you to subscribe to blogs and news websites (e.g., CNN, BBC) via RSS feeds. Once subscribed, you will automatically receive updates whenever new articles or posts are published.

## Motivation

This project serves as a practical exercise in implementing relational tables and techniques in PostgreSQL. Beyond its educational value, it's also a fun and useful way to stay informed by aggregating content from your favorite blogs and news sources into one place.
